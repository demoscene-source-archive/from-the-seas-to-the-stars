rendered output needs to be brighter, i think.

00:00 - view of ocean, very blurry, shafts/rays of light, show the cubes hanging in space
00:20 - coming in to focus
00:43 - floating with the jellyfish, with cube
01:01 - floating with the ammonites, with cube
01:19 - small fishes and green floating plant things
01:37 - 1st cube-to-fish transition
01:44 - 2nd cube-to-fish transition
01:53 - 3rd cube-to-fish transition, the three fishes swim around and start to come together
02:19 - the big and complete koi-like fish emerges from the combination and swims
02:54 - the other sea animals start to follow the big fish (the camera is still but the fish flies past, then the animals)
03:10 - the world is starting to dissolve, except for the sea animals which are rising out
			(camera is following along with them, ground and ocean surface visible, which then rise/dissolve).
03:25 - you see that they are rising in to space, to a galaxy/stars
			in the process of the world around them disolving, they become ethereal, become like stars -> become star signs/formations. when this happens their colours/bodies fall away
